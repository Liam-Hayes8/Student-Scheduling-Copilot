# Project Progress

Track implementation status and next steps for the Student Scheduling Copilot.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2) ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Completed
- Project structure and monorepo setup
- README with architecture overview
- License and documentation structure
- Next.js frontend scaffold with TypeScript
- Node/Express backend scaffold with TypeScript  
- Google OAuth setup with next-auth
- Basic UI with input box and event display panel
- Environment configuration and Docker setup

## Phase 2: Core Services (Days 3-4) ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Completed
- Planner module - sophisticated natural language parsing
- LLM Orchestrator with OpenAI function calling
- Calendar Agent for Google Calendar API integration
- Dry-run MVP (parse, analyze, display - no actual writes)

## Phase 3: Calendar Integration (Day 5) ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Completed
- Conflict detection and resolution algorithms
- Three-alternative ranking system with scoring
- User confirmation flow in UI
- Actual calendar write operations (with dry-run mode)
- Audit logging system with Postgres

## Phase 4: RAG & Database (Day 6) ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Completed
- Postgres + pgvector setup with Docker
- Complete database schema with Prisma
- Audit trail and user preferences
- Vector embeddings setup for future RAG
- Database service layer

### 🔜 Future Enhancements
- [ ] PDF upload and parsing for syllabi
- [ ] Syllabus data chunking and embedding
- [ ] "Import exam dates" functionality
- [ ] Vector search for user rules

## Phase 5: MVP Polish ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Completed
- Schema validation and error handling
- TypeScript throughout the stack
- Comprehensive API routes
- Docker containerization
- Development setup scripts
- Integration between all services

### 🔜 Next Steps for Production
- [ ] Unit tests for all modules
- [ ] E2E test scenarios (recurring, DST, conflicts)
- [ ] Production deployment to Vercel/Cloud Run
- [ ] Cost and latency monitoring
- [ ] 90-second demo video

## Current Status: DRY-RUN MVP COMPLETE! 🎉

**What Works Now:**
- ✅ Natural language parsing ("Block 7–9pm Tu/Th for EE labs")
- ✅ Intelligent constraint extraction and time slot generation
- ✅ OpenAI-powered intent analysis with fallback to rule-based parsing
- ✅ Google Calendar OAuth integration
- ✅ Conflict detection and alternative suggestions
- ✅ Complete audit trail of all operations
- ✅ Responsive UI with real-time feedback
- ✅ Database persistence of users, preferences, and sessions

**Next Phase**: Production deployment and advanced features (RAG, syllabus parsing)

## Architecture Implemented

```
Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
├── Google OAuth authentication
├── Scheduling interface with natural language input
├── Real-time event plan display
└── Conflict resolution UI

Backend API (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
├── Planner Service (rule-based NL parsing)
├── LLM Orchestrator (OpenAI function calling)
├── Calendar Agent (Google Calendar API)
└── Database Service (Prisma + PostgreSQL)

Database (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
├── User management and preferences
├── Audit logging for all operations
├── Scheduling session tracking
└── Vector embeddings (ready for RAG)
```

## Quality Gates ✅ PASSED

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All services properly integrated
- ✅ Error handling and validation in place
- ✅ Database schema and migrations working
- ✅ Docker configuration tested
- ✅ Authentication flow complete

## Demo-Ready Features

1. **Natural Language Processing**: "Study 7-9pm Tu/Th" → structured events
2. **Intelligent Fallbacks**: LLM → rule-based parsing for reliability
3. **Conflict Detection**: Analyzes existing calendar events
4. **Alternative Suggestions**: Ranked options with explanations
5. **Audit Trail**: Every action logged for enterprise compliance
6. **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile
7. **Real-time Processing**: Immediate feedback on input
