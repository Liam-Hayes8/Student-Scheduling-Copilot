# Project Progress

Track implementation status and next steps for the Student Scheduling Copilot.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2) âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed
- Project structure and monorepo setup
- README with architecture overview
- License and documentation structure
- Next.js frontend scaffold with TypeScript
- Node/Express backend scaffold with TypeScript  
- Google OAuth setup with next-auth
- Basic UI with input box and event display panel
- Environment configuration and Docker setup

## Phase 2: Core Services (Days 3-4) âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed
- Planner module - sophisticated natural language parsing
- LLM Orchestrator with OpenAI function calling
- Calendar Agent for Google Calendar API integration
- Dry-run MVP (parse, analyze, display - no actual writes)

## Phase 3: Calendar Integration (Day 5) âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed
- Conflict detection and resolution algorithms
- Three-alternative ranking system with scoring
- User confirmation flow in UI
- Actual calendar write operations (with dry-run mode)
- Audit logging system with Postgres

## Phase 4: RAG & Database (Day 6) âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed
- Postgres + pgvector setup with Docker
- Complete database schema with Prisma
- Audit trail and user preferences
- Vector embeddings setup for future RAG
- Database service layer

### âœ… RAG Syllabus Parser - COMPLETED
- [x] PDF upload and parsing for syllabi
- [x] Syllabus data chunking and embedding
- [x] "Import exam dates" functionality
- [x] Vector search for user rules
- [x] Course information extraction
- [x] Event type classification (exam, assignment, quiz, project)
- [x] Confidence scoring for extracted events
- [x] Frontend interface for syllabus upload and management

## Phase 5: MVP Polish âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed
- Schema validation and error handling
- TypeScript throughout the stack
- Comprehensive API routes
- Docker containerization
- Development setup scripts
- Integration between all services

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps for Production
- [ ] Unit tests for all modules
- [ ] E2E test scenarios (recurring, DST, conflicts)
- [ ] Production deployment to Vercel/Cloud Run
- [ ] Cost and latency monitoring
- [ ] 90-second demo video

## Current Status: DRY-RUN MVP COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

**What Works Now:**
- âœ… Natural language parsing ("Block 7â€“9pm Tu/Th for EE labs")
- âœ… Intelligent constraint extraction and time slot generation
- âœ… OpenAI-powered intent analysis with fallback to rule-based parsing
- âœ… Google Calendar OAuth integration
- âœ… Conflict detection and alternative suggestions
- âœ… Complete audit trail of all operations
- âœ… Responsive UI with real-time feedback
- âœ… Database persistence of users, preferences, and sessions
- âœ… **NEW: RAG Syllabus Parser** - PDF upload, exam date extraction, course info parsing
- âœ… **NEW: Syllabus Event Management** - Search, filter, and import to calendar
- âœ… **NEW: Advanced UI** - Tabbed interface with scheduling and syllabus management

**Next Phase**: Production deployment and advanced features (multi-calendar, preference learning)

## Architecture Implemented

```
Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
â”œâ”€â”€ Google OAuth authentication
â”œâ”€â”€ Scheduling interface with natural language input
â”œâ”€â”€ Real-time event plan display
â””â”€â”€ Conflict resolution UI

Backend API (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
â”œâ”€â”€ Planner Service (rule-based NL parsing)
â”œâ”€â”€ LLM Orchestrator (OpenAI function calling)
â”œâ”€â”€ Calendar Agent (Google Calendar API)
â””â”€â”€ Database Service (Prisma + PostgreSQL)

Database (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
â”œâ”€â”€ User management and preferences
â”œâ”€â”€ Audit logging for all operations
â”œâ”€â”€ Scheduling session tracking
â””â”€â”€ Vector embeddings (ready for RAG)
```

## Quality Gates âœ… PASSED

- âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
- âœ… All services properly integrated
- âœ… Error handling and validation in place
- âœ… Database schema and migrations working
- âœ… Docker configuration tested
- âœ… Authentication flow complete

## Demo-Ready Features

1. **Natural Language Processing**: "Study 7-9pm Tu/Th" â†’ structured events
2. **Intelligent Fallbacks**: LLM â†’ rule-based parsing for reliability
3. **Conflict Detection**: Analyzes existing calendar events
4. **Alternative Suggestions**: Ranked options with explanations
5. **Audit Trail**: Every action logged for enterprise compliance
6. **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile
7. **Real-time Processing**: Immediate feedback on input
