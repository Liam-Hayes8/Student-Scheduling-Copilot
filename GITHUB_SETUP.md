# GitHub Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to upload your Student Scheduling Copilot to GitHub:

## Step 1: Initialize Local Git Repository

```bash
cd /Users/liamhayes/Student-Scheduling-Copilot

# Rename the gitignore file
mv gitignore .gitignore

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Student Scheduling Copilot MVP

- OpenAI LLM orchestrator with intelligent fallbacks
- Google Calendar API integration with conflict detection
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector for audit trails
- Docker containerization for development
- TypeScript throughout the stack
- Enterprise-grade architecture with audit logging

Features:
✅ Natural language parsing ('Block 7–9pm Tu/Th for EE labs')
✅ AI-powered intent analysis with confidence scoring
✅ Conflict detection and alternative suggestions
✅ Complete audit trail for enterprise compliance
✅ Responsive UI with real-time feedback
✅ Production-ready infrastructure"
```

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `student-scheduling-copilot`
5. Description: `AI-powered scheduling assistant with natural language processing and Google Calendar integration`
6. Make it **Public** (to showcase in your portfolio)
7. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/student-scheduling-copilot.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Add Repository Topics (for discoverability)

In your GitHub repository:
1. Click the gear icon next to "About"
2. Add these topics:
   - `nextjs`
   - `typescript`
   - `ai`
   - `scheduling`
   - `google-calendar`
   - `openai`
   - `postgresql`
   - `docker`
   - `natural-language-processing`
   - `enterprise-software`
   - `workday`
   - `calendar-integration`

## Step 5: Update Repository Description

In the "About" section, add:
- Description: "Enterprise-grade scheduling assistant that parses natural language requests and integrates with Google Calendar. Features AI-powered conflict resolution, audit trails, and sophisticated architecture patterns."
- Website: (leave blank for now)
- Check ✅ "Use your GitHub Pages website"

## Step 6: Create a Professional README

The repository already includes a comprehensive README.md with:
- Architecture diagrams
- Setup instructions
- Technology choices and rationale
- Demo script
- Enterprise features

## Step 7: Portfolio Integration

Add this to your resume/portfolio:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-scheduling-copilot
- **Demo**: (You can deploy to Vercel for a live demo)
- **Key Technologies**: Next.js, TypeScript, OpenAI, Google Calendar API, PostgreSQL, Docker

## Step 8: Optional - Deploy for Live Demo

Deploy the frontend to Vercel:
```bash
cd frontend
npx vercel
```

Deploy the backend to Railway or Render for a complete live demo.
